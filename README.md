## Experience

Here are a few highlights of my experience as a React JS developer:

- Developed my [portfolio](https://prakash-agrahari.vercel.app/) that helped to showcase my skills and to brush my React skills.
- Built a [Component Library (Pencil UI)](https://pencil-ui.netlify.app/) that helped me to refine my raw HTML and CSS skills and also it gave me satisfaction that I have created my own library with predefined CSS-classes just like another bootstrap.
